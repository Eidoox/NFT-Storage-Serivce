### NFT Storage Service
- NFT.Storage is a free and secure service by Protocol Labs that allows users to store and protect their NFT assets and their metadata through content addressing and decentralized storage to ensure that all NFTs follow best practices to stay accessible long-term.
- I wrote a blog to explain everything about the amazing NFT.Storage service. In addition, I have implemented a website application that helps you to to make it simple to upload your metadata and image, then a link for metadata and image will be generated "all of these in one click only on an upload button".
